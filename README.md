# AVFoundationCamera

An iOS camera app project that I am working on. It's not finished, especially the design, but the base of
the program is there where I can use this to eventually build a stand alone iOS app or add these features to other apps that I am working on.

## Features

- Customized camera using AVFoundation

- Draw pad, with color pencil and eraser

- Caption feature which allows you to add text to your image



Here's what it looks like so far:
